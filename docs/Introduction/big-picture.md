# Big Picture 

JHipster is a well-known platform for generating modern application.
jhipster-dotnet is a full-fledged generator that allows you to generate web applications in .NET.
The generator generates the back-end and the front-end.

We did this project because the Jhipster team made jhipster-lite.
Currently, there are several problems with the JHipster and jhipster-dotnetcore projects:

- The projects have become too complex for contribution

- The languages of the generator and the generated project are not the same. This hinders the contribution of people who do not know both languages.

So we created jhipster-dotnet to answer these problems, here are the objectives: 

- To allow a step by step application generation. There is no questionnaire, the user interaction is done via the front-end. This allows the user what he needs without being restricted.

- Simplify the generation by offering fewer features. It is a "lightened" version

- Attract more developers to contribute. generator language = generated language.
